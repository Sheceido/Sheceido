- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sheceido
- 👀 I’m interested ... ThreeJS, Game Development, Web Applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C# / Unity, React

- 🛠️ I've recently created ...
-       https://sheceido.github.io/PerfectStack/ :: using the Unity Game Engine to recreate a fun stacking game I played at Rec Room (currently non-functional for macOS / iOS - may be due to SRP project settings).
-       https://sheceido.github.io/anata-no-room/ :: using the power of ThreeJS and tinkering with 3d modeling with blender, created a simple 3d room with prompts and camera functionality.
-       https://nyghmfm.pythonanywhere.com/demo :: written primarily in html and css with a tinker of JS, along with a simple python/flask backend routing system for the NYGH MFM obstetrics clinic.

- 👷 I'm currently working on ...
-  Refactoring my unity PerfectStack game to follow SOLID principles, and recreating the project under URP settings to test for iOS / macOS support.
-  FullStackOpen course to learn React and to further improve backend development.
